Welcome to the Dynamics 4 GitHub page!

Here you will find some resources in the form of Jupyter notebooks, which can be used to provide an interactive visualisation of some of the dynamics concepts covered in the course, in both tutorial exercises and demo sessions. 

If you are unfamiliar with the use of Jupyter notebooks, we have included a notebook titled 'Running Code.ipynb', which gives a short tutorial.

We suggest importing this GitHub page using the University's Noteable service through Learn, which we will demonstrate in the first examples class.

If you have any other questions, I would also be happy to discuss over email, at: thomas.aston@ed.ac.uk
